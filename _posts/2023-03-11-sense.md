[h4]Sense[/h4]

[img=images/sense/senselogo.png]

Sense is classified as easy.  Let's see if that makes any "sense". [more]

[h4]Enumeration[/h4]

[h5]nmap[/h5]

My nmapLaunch script runs the -T4, -A, and -p- switches...

[img=images/sense/nmap.png width=500]

80 and 443 are the only ports open, and indeed dropping the IP into a browser redirects to port 443 and a login page for [url=https://www.pfsense.org/ target="_blank"]PFSense[/url], an open-source firewall/router software solution.

[img=images/sense/page.png]

Well, that makes "sense".

[h5]Dirbuster[/h5]

[img=images/sense/dirb1.png width=500]

Directory brute-forcing with Dirbuster returned two interesting findings using the medium wordlist.

[h4]Foothold[/h4]

Okay, so it's not fully patched, and now I have a username and a hint for the password.  A little Google-fu says that the default PFSense password is pfsense.  Logging in, I get a standard dashboard page with no significant interaction, although it does divulge that it's version 2.1.3.

[img=images/sense/loggedin.png width=500]


[h4]Exploit[/h4]


This calls for a little more Google-Fu.  I search for PFSense exploit, and get an [url=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43560 target="_blank"]Exploit-DB hit for PFSense versions 2.1.4 and older.[/url]  Reviewing the code, it's a command injection script that alters the status_rrd_graph_img.php file.  There is indeed an RRD Graph page on the status menu for the dashboard.  The script is  also authenticated, so good thing I have the creds.

[h4]Shell[/h4]

I set up a netcat listener, and fire off the script...

[img=images/sense/script2.png width=500]

...and got a root shell!

[img=images/sense/shell.png]


[h4]Flags[/h4]


It's easy to capture both flags without much further ado.

[img=images/sense/flags.png]

This is where I'll end this walkthrough.  Of course, having root I could do so much more.

This box offered practice for the basics.
